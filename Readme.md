# Alcardian's Long Spells
## Description
### Alcardian's Long Spells
A small spell mod that increases spell duration & adds some smaller changes

### Features:
* Changed duration on most buffs & summons to 7200 seconds (2h). 
* Added "updates_on_transformed = false;" to non-LOA buffs to prevent spell from playing its effects on transformed creatures. Same as non-modded/unchanged LOA buffs have. 
* Increased XP from "Healing Wind" to better match "Battle Healing"

### Notes:
Remember that there is an **Unsummon** (default keybind: U) & **Untransform** (default keybind: Y) action, check keybinds ingame. Can be useful if summon gets stuck or you want to exit transformation early.

### Requirements:
Only host in multiplayer needs the mod for it to be enabled. Mod doesn't break compatibility with non-modded game clients.


### Installation instructions:
* Unzip `Alcardian_LongSpells_<ds/dsloa>.zip`
* Copy `Alcardian_LongSpells_<ds/dsloa>.dsres` to Resources folder



### Dev notes
* Folder path for files: world\contentdb\templates\regular\interactive
    * Include for LOA: "spl_spell.gas" & "dsx_spl_spell.gas"
    * Include for DS (non-LOA): "spl_spell.gas"

### TODO
* Look into excluded spells
